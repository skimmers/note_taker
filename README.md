# Note Taker

## Installation/Deployment

Go to this link: <https://github.com/skimmers/note_taker/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages> and examine the files. Download the files and open the server.js file in visiual studio code and type "node server.js" in the integrated terminal to run the application. Here is my heroku link: <https://note-taker-gatech.herokuapp.com/>.

## Goal

The goal is to use JavaScript, Node.js, Inquirer, and Express to create a note taker app.

These are the requirements I had to meet: 

* GIVEN a note-taking application
* WHEN I open the Note Taker
* THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
* WHEN I click on the Save icon
* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
* THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
* WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
* THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

# Purpose

I believe the purpose of this assignment was to not only get me coding and understand how to create databases and servers but also understand the purpose of servers and databases.

I learned how to download inquirer, creating package.json files, and use express.
