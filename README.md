# Note Taker

## Installation/Deployment

Go to this link: <https://github.com/skimmers/note_taker/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages> and examine the files. Download the files and open the server.js file in visiual studio code and type "node server.js" in the integrated terminal to run the application. 

## Goal

The goal is to use JavaScript, Node.js, Inquirer, and Express to create a note taker app.

These are the requirements I had to meet: 

* GIVEN a note-taking application
* WHEN I open the Note Taker
* THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
* WHEN I click on the Save icon
* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
* THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
* WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
* THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

# Purpose

I believe the purpose of this assignment was to not only get me coding and understand how to create databases and servers but also understand the purpose of servers and databases.

I learned how to download inquirer, creating package.json files, and use express.

# Note

I was unable to successfully complete this assignment. For some reason, I am unable to save my notes. If there is any advice as to how to fix this please let me know!
